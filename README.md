# Poseidon's Gate
## Story
You and your crew of adventurers are racing across the open seas in search of the mythical island of Atlantis. Legends say that whoever reaches its shores first will claim a prize beyond imagination.

But you’re not the only ones seeking it. Ruthless pirates stalk the waters, determined to stop anyone from reaching the island before them. As you sail deeper into uncharted territory, the battles grow fiercer, and the race for Atlantis becomes a fight for survival.

## Gameplay
This is a round-based, top-down shooter where you upgrade your gear and unlock powerful new weapons as you progress.

The game consists of 9 rounds, each containing more enemies than the last.

Every 3 rounds, a unique boss appears. Defeating them is required to advance.

After completing a round or defeating a boss, you’ll earn a large sum of coins.  These can be spent in the store on weapon upgrades, stat boosts, and gear improvements.

Throughout the round, pickupable items will spawn:

Coins – boost your currency

Max Ammo – the primary way to replenish your ammunition during combat

The health system consists of hearts that are shielded with planks. Once the shield is broken by taking damage, and the heart is exposed, the player may lose the heart and will not be able to regenerate unless they have a healing potion, which is purchased in the shop. Shields may be repaired throughout the round with planks.

Defeating enemies will also provide you with planks, which you will be able to use to replenish your shield

Your goal: survive all 9 rounds, defeat every boss, and reach Atlantis before the pirates do.
